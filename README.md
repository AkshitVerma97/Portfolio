## Projects

### Lending Club: Algorithmic Investment Strategy Fall 2025 | Data Mining and Financial Analysis [LINK]()

Designed a quantitative business plan for a $5M Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending fund, analyzing a dataset of over 1 million loan records to identify high-yield borrower segments. Evaluated the feasibility of Machine Learning classifiers (SVM, Neural Networks) for default prediction, conducting a gap analysis between the model’s performance (AUROC 0.69) and industry baselines to assess deployment viability.

Constructed a financial revenue model projecting a Net Annualized Return (NAR) of 9-11%, significantly outperforming passive market indices. The strategy focused on bridging the gap between data science and financial constraints, prioritizing feature engineering and risk management over raw algorithmic complexity to ensure fund solvency.

### Boeing Crisis: Organizational Behavior Case Study Fall 2025 | Organizational Behavior [LINK]()

Analyzed the Boeing 737 MAX crisis to diagnose the organizational shift from an engineering-centric culture to one driven by financial metrics. Applied frameworks like Expectancy Theory and Psychological Safety to show how management practices discouraged dissent and severed the link between safety efforts and rewards.

Developed a strategic turnaround plan centered on re-establishing engineering literacy at the executive level. Proposed a new incentive structure that aligns leadership goals with safety and ethics rather than just speed, offering a roadmap to restore operational integrity.
